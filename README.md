## Phases of Play
### tweetstorm
Each round begins with a tweetstorm phase, players draw a card from the tweet deck and place it on the next spot in the timeline. Each tweet adds new rules/values/conditions to gameplay. Rules are cumulative unless a 'fact check' is played during the "organizing" phase, in which case that rule is cancelled.

### Fundraising
After the Tweetstorm, during "fundraising" phase, players collect 'likes' which are assigned based on a table for their faction and the categories of population in specific locations. 

Population tokens represent different numbers of likes, depending on which side of the token is showing:
 - Police/bastard cop,   
 - Protestors/rioter,   
 - NIMBY/Woke Neighbors,  

there are also special tokens indicating the following:
 - agent provocateur
 - live streamer
 - dead-media broadcast


During the fundraising phase: 
1. blm and dba faction players receive one like for each protestor at a location, but each protestor is worth two likes if there is a live-streamer present
2. Antifa and Troll players receive one like for each rioter, or two likes if there is a dead-media broadcaster present  
3. dba and trolls receive one like for each police, or two if there is a dead-media broadcaster present
4. antifa and blm receive one like for each woke militia, or two likes if there is a live-streamer present
etc.

### Negotiation
Likes can be exchanged for resources or can be used in forming alliances in the "negotiation" phase. resources include food, guns, spraypaint, webcams, gardening supplies, police scanners, etc. These resources allow Actions, but do not contribute directly to scoring "clout".

### Organizing
#### Actions
During the "Organizing" phase, Action cards are drawn and can be played on a location by spending the required resources to implement the action in the chosen location if the population in that location is sufficient. Action cards include "Peaceful Protest", "Melee", "Block Party", "Press Conference", "Agent Provovateur" and other special actions.

##### Locations:
1. east precinct
2. Cal anderson park
3. northwest liquor
4. the cuff
5. sunset apartments
6. elliot bay
7. rancho bravo
8. hollow earth radio
9. Vermillion
10. Doghouse Leather
11. Central Co-Op
12. Velocity Dance
13. Caffe Vita
14. blick art Supplies
15. fire station
16. cupcakes
17. ...

#### Alliances
Alliances allow any two players to combine their resources to playing one action. If another player plays an "expose" action card on an action made possible by an alliance, populations in a given location may have their alignment changed according to the rules on the expose card. 
#### Chaos
If a "Chaos" card is drawn from the action deck by any player, it must be played immediately. "Chaos" cards include 
 - "Active Shooter", 
 - "Puppies!", 
 - "Pink Umbrella Storm", 
 - "Learn-in", 
 - "Picnic", 
 - "Covid Outbreak"  
 - "street preacher appears"

### Protest
During the "protest" phase, the following population tokens on the board are moved, multiplied, changed state, or removed from the board based on the Actions played during the organizing phase. Each population can have state change when "affected" making them worth a different balance of consciousness  and property damage at the end of each round, 
#### Outbreak
If Covid 19 is applied to a location, the population in that location are no longer active, and no clout is awarded.
#### Property Damage
property values increase or decrease based on cumulative damage. Damage or improvement may occur with each Action that happens in a given location. Each location sustains a certain amount of property damage, before it is considered "destroyed" and all population in that location will leave. 
#### Consciousness
Consciousness is the relative measure of public awareness of the inequity in the status quo.

## Completion
The game continues until there are no police (abolition), no protestors (return to status quo), or no residents (failed state) remaining on the board, in which case the final Clout score is calculated.

## Scoring
There are two axes for calculating clout, resulting in four different win conditions

       ↑ 
    ←- + -→  property values					     
       ↓
         Public Consciousness

- High Property Values, Low Public Consciousness: DBA win
- Low Property Values, High Pubic Consciousness: Antifa win
- High Property Values, High Consciousness: BLM win
- Low Property Values, Low Consciousness: Trolls win
